# Data Science Cookie Cutter
## Quick Start
### Set up the environment
1. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
2. Set up the environment:
```bash
make setup
make activate
```
### Install new packages
To install new PyPI packages, run:
```bash
poetry add <package-name>
```

### Run Python scripts
To run the Python scripts to process data, train model, and run a notebook, type the following:
```bash
make pipeline
```
### View all flow runs
A [flow](https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/flows/) is the basis of all Prefect workflows.

To view your flow runs from a UI, sign in to your [Prefect Cloud](https://app.prefect.cloud/) account or spin up a Prefect Orion server on your local machine:
```bash
prefect orion start
```
Open the URL http://127.0.0.1:4200/, and you should see the Prefect UI:

### Run flows from the UI

After [creating a deployment](https://towardsdatascience.com/build-a-full-stack-ml-application-with-pydantic-and-prefect-915f00fe0c62?sk=b1f8c5cb53a6a9d7f48d66fa778e9cf0), you can run a flow from the UI with default parameters:
